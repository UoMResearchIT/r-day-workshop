This is an abridged and modified version of the Software Carpentry lesson [R for reproducible scientific analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder).  

The original lesson includes tuition on using [git](https://git-scm.com/) for source control. The University offers a separate course on this, which can be booked online at [http://app.manchester.ac.uk/RGIT](http://app.manchester.ac.uk/RGIT) (university logon required).


The slide deck used in the course can be found [https://mawds.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/slides/](here).


The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to use R for data analysis. R is commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis and its array of third-party packages greatly extend its usefulness.  The emphasis of these materials is to give attendees a strong foundation in the fundamentals of R, and to teach best practices for scientific computing.

Note that this workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the
programming language R, and will not teach statistical analysis.

A variety of third party packages are used throughout this workshop. These
are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are
packages we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their
usability.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Understand that computers store data and instructions (programs, scripts etc.) in files.
> Files are organised in directories (folders).
> Know how to access files not in the working directory by specifying the path.
> 
> Download the example data we will use for the lesson from [https://github.com/mawds/r-novice-gapminder/raw/gh-pages/data/r-novice.zip](here.)
