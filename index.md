This is the website for the Northwest Universties R day "Introduction to the Tidyverse Workshop".   The course material is an abridged and modified version of the [R for Data Analysis](https://uomresearchit.github.io/r-tidyverse-intro/) course that is offered by [Research IT](http://www.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/research/) at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk).

The full day [R for Data Analysis](https://uomresearchit.github.io/r-tidyverse-intro/) course is itself an abridged and modified version of the Software Carpentry lesson [R for reproducible scientific analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder).  

**[The slide deck used in this course can be found here]({{ page.root }}/slides/).**


The goal of this workshop is to introduce the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) to users who are familiar with R.

The tidyverse describes itself as:

> an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 


The packages are designed to work well together, are well thought through, and nice to use.  They can make your data analysis process significantly easier and quicker than using base R alone.
