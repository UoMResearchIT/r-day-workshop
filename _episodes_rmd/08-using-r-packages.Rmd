At the start of the course we showed how to install packages in R, and installed some packages that we've been using in the rest of the course.  In this lesson we will cover finding packages that will be useful in *your* research.  One of the many strengths of R is its packaging system; this makes it (relatively) easy to distribute code you have written for others to use, and to use other people's code in your analysis.  

In addition to providing a convenient way of providing an a set of tools to perform a task, packages can also call code written in other languages.  In many packages much of the computationally intensive work is performed with code written in C or Fortran.

There are several sources of packages in R:

## CRAN

[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) is the main repository of packages for R.  All the packages have undergone basic quality assurance when they were submitted.  There are over 10,000 packages in the archive; there is a lot of overlap between some packages.  Working out _what_ the most appropriate package to use isn't always straightforward.   

## Bioconductor

[Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) is a more specalised repository, which contains packages for bioinformatics.  Common workflows are provided, and the packages are more thoroughly quality assured.   Because of its more specialised nature we don't focus on Bioconductor in this course.

## Github / personal websites

Some authors distribute packages via [Github](https://www.github.com) or their own personal web-pages.  These packages may not have undergone any form of quality assurance.   Note that many packages have their own website, but are also available on CRAN.

> Discuss your area of research with your neighbour, and think about the analyses you might do in R.   We will go through these as a group, and then pick an example to use.

## Finding packages to help with your research

There are various ways of finding packages that might be useful in your research:


* The [CRAN task view](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) provides an overview of the packages available for various research fields.   

* Journal articles should cite the R packages they used in their analysis. 

* [The Journal of Statistical Software](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index) contains peer-reviewed articles for R packages (and other statistical software)

* [The R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/) contains articles about new packages in R.

* Asking colleagues

## Example

Meta analysis -

Overview of what it is

Assume we've been given some data that we have to meta-analyse.   

[R task view](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MetaAnalysis.html) - convenient.  Let's assume we want to fit using the inverse-variance method - 4 packages.  How do we choose?


Look at the package page for each of the 4 packages:

* [epiR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/epiR/index.html)
* [meta](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meta/index.html)
* [metafor](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metafor/index.html)
* [rmeta](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmeta/index.html)

Any of these packages should be able to do the task we want.  Useful things to look for when deciding:

* Package updated regularly (look at version number, publication date)
* How easy it will be to use -- the reference manual is not a tutorial.  Package vignettes are often tutorials.
* Colleagues' recommendations
