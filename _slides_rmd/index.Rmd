    + Abridged
    + Doesn't cover topics that overlap with other Research IT courses
  
## Teaching methods

* The course is _interactive_
    + These are the only slides
  
## Other courses from Research IT

* We offer courses on [many aspects of scientific computing](http://www.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/our-services/research/training/)
    + All are free for staff and PGRs
