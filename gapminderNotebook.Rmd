title: "Analysis of gapminder data"

In this notebook we load and examine the Gapminder data.

Firstly, we load the required libraries and data:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
getwd()
gapminder <- read_csv("./_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv",
                      col_types = cols(
                        country = col_character(),
                        year = col_integer(),
                        pop = col_double(),
                        continent = col_character(),
                        lifeExp = col_double(),
                        gdpPercap = col_double()
                      ))
```

We can look at the mean and median life expectancy for the countries in each contient for 2007:

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(meanexp = mean(lifeExp), medexp = median(lifeExp))
```

What if we wanted to look at a different year?  "2007" appears in two places in the notebook. We
could easily forget to change one of them if we're interested in a different year. 

Better:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
myyear <- 2002
```

We can look at the the mean and median life expectancy for the countries in each continent for `r myyear`:


```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == myyear) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(meanexp = mean(lifeExp), medexp = median(lifeExp))
```

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
