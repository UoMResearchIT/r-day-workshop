## Files
*We will be using some example data in the lesson.  Download the file from [here]({{ page.root }}/data/r-novice.zip) and extract it to your computer*

## Software
This lesson assumes you have the R and RStudio software installed on your computer. 

R can be downloaded [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/).

RStudio is an environment for developing using R.
It can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
You will need the Desktop version for your computer; scroll to the bottom of the page for links.

## R packages

The workshop is about using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org). You will need to install this on your R session.  To do this enter:
`install.packages("tidyverse")` at the R console prompt.

Installation will take several minutes, so it is worth doing this at the very start of the workshop.
