## Software
This lesson assumes you have the R and RStudio software installed on your computer. This should already be the case if you are using the University computers.

R can be downloaded [here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).

RStudio is an environment for developing using R.
It can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
You will need the Desktop version for your computer; scroll to the bottom of the page for links.

We will use some additional R packages in the course; these are already installed on the university computers.  We will discuss how to install packages during the course; if you are using your own computer you can install them then.
