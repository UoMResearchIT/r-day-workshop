## Introduction

The scientific process is naturally incremental, and many projects
start life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and
eventually everything is a bit mixed together.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Managing your projects in a reproducible fashion doesn't just make your science reproducible, it makes your life easier.</p>â€” Vince Buffalo (@vsbuffalo) <a href="https://twitter.com/vsbuffalo/status/323638476153167872">April 15, 2013</a></blockquote>

Most people tend to organize their projects like this:

![](../fig/02-bad_layout.png)

There are many reasons why we should *ALWAYS* avoid this:

1. It is really hard to tell which version of your data is
the original and which is the modified;
2. It gets really messy because it mixes files with various
extensions together;
3. It probably takes you a lot of time to actually find
things, and relate the correct figures to the exact code
that has been used to generate it;

A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:

* It will help ensure the integrity of your data;
* It makes it simpler to share your code with someone else
(a lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);
* It allows you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission;
* It makes it easier to pick the project back up after a break.

## A possible solution

Fortunately, there are tools and packages which can help you manage your work effectively.

One of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is its project management
functionality. We'll be using this today to create a self-contained, reproducible
project.

> ## Version control
> 
> It is always a good idea to use version control with your projects.  
> This makes it easy to undo changes to your code, scripts and documents, and to collaborate with others. 
> We don't cover version control in this course, however [Research IT offers a course on using git](http://app.manchester.ac.uk/RGIT)
> (logon required). [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a popular version control system, 
> that integrates well with Rstudio.  Git makes collaboration with others easy when it is used in 
> conjunction with [github](https://www.github.com).

> ## Challenge: Creating a self-contained project
>
> We're going to create a new project in RStudio:
>
> 1. Click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
> 2. Click "New Directory".
> 3. Click "Empty Project".
> 4. Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g. "my_project".
> 5. Click the "Create Project" button.
{: .challenge}

Now when we start R in this project directory, or open this project with RStudio,
all of our work on this project will be entirely self-contained in this directory.

## Best practices for project organization

Although there is no "best" way to lay out a project, there are some general
principles to adhere to that will make project management easier:

### Treat data as read only

This is probably the most important goal of setting up a project. Data is
typically time consuming and/or expensive to collect. Working with them
interactively (e.g., in Excel) where they can be modified means you are never
sure of where the data came from, or how it has been modified since collection.
It is therefore a good idea to treat your data as "read-only".

### Data Cleaning

In many cases your data will be "dirty": it will need significant preprocessing
to get into a format R (or any other programming language) will find useful. This
task is sometimes called "data munging". I find it useful to store these scripts
in a separate folder, and create a second "read-only" data folder to hold the
"cleaned" data sets.

### Treat generated output as disposable

Anything generated by your scripts should be treated as disposable: it should
all be able to be regenerated from your scripts.

There are lots of different ways to manage this output. I find it useful to
have an output folder with different sub-directories for each separate
analysis. This makes it easier later, as many of my analyses are exploratory
and don't end up being used in the final project, and some of the analyses
get shared between projects.

> ## Tip: Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing
>
> [Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing](https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/blob/gh-pages/good-enough-practices-for-scientific-computing.pdf) gives the following recommendations for project organization:
>
> 1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
> 2. Put text documents associated with the project in the `doc` directory.
> 3. Put raw data and metadata in the `data` directory, and files generated during clean-up and analysis in a `results` directory.
> 4. Put source for the project's scripts and programs in the `src` directory, and programs brought in from elsewhere or compiled locally in the `bin` directory.
> 5. Name all files to reflect their content or function.

### Separate function definition and application

The most effective way I find to work in R, is to play around in the interactive
session, then copy commands across to a script file when I'm sure they work and
do what I want. You can also save all the commands you've entered using the
`history` command, but I don't find it useful because when I'm typing its 90%
trial and error.

R studio also shows your command history; click the "history" tab in the top right window.  Multiple lines of history can be selected (by clicking while holding down the shift key), and then copied to the console or to your source window.

When your project is new and shiny, the script file usually contains many lines
of directly executed code. As it matures, reusable chunks get pulled into their
own functions. It's a good idea to separate these into separate folders; one
to store useful functions that you'll reuse across analyses and projects, and
one to store the analysis scripts.


> ## Tip: avoiding duplication
>
> You may find yourself using data or analysis scripts across several projects.
> Typically you want to avoid duplication to save space and avoid having to
> make updates to code in multiple places.  There are several ways of handling this:
>
> It may be useful to make "symbolic links", which are essentially
> shortcuts to files somewhere else on a filesystem. On Linux and OS X you can
> use the `ln -s` command, and on Windows you can either create a short-cut or
> use the `mklink` command from the windows terminal.
>
> Alternatively, you can develop your own package, and put your scripts and functions in this.  Although this 
> is more complex it easier to share your methods with others.  Creating packages isn't covered in this course; a good book on the topic is Hadley Wickham's [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/).

### Save the data in the data directory

Now we have a good directory structure we will now place/save the data file in the `data/` directory.

> ## Challenge 1
> Copy the files `gapminder-FiveYearData.csv`, and `feline-data_v2.csv` files from the [zip file you downloaded]({{ page.root }}/data/r-novice.zip) as part of the lesson set up to the `data/` folder within your project.  Also create a `src/` and `results/` folder within your project.
> We will use these data later in the course.
>
> Note that you cannot drag and drop files from Windows Explorer
> (or your operating system's equivalent) into the files window in RStudio.   You can
> get a new Windows Explorer (or equivalent) window for the location shown in the the
> files tab of RStudio by clicking "More" and selecting "Show folder in new window".
> You can then drag and drop the the required files into the folder.
>
> You may find that you need to click the "refresh" icon in RStudio's file window
> before the files appear in RStudio

## Managing your environment

In this section we will discuss ways of keeping your environment tidy.

`ls` will list all of the variables and functions stored in the global environment
(your working R session):


~~~
ls()
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "args"          "dest_md"       "missing_pkgs"  "required_pkgs"
[5] "src_rmd"      
~~~
{: .output}

Information on the objects in your environment is also available from the environment panel in RStudio.

> ## Tip: hidden objects
>
> Like in the shell, `ls` will hide any variables or functions starting
> with a `.` by default. To list all objects, type `ls(all.names=TRUE)`
> instead
>
{: .callout}

Note here that we didn't given any arguments to `ls`, but we still
needed to give the parentheses to tell R to call the function.

You can use `rm` to delete objects you no longer need. To delete `x`:


~~~
x <- 5
x
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 5
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
rm(x)
x
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'x' not found
~~~
{: .error}

If you have lots of things in your environment and want to delete all of them,
you can pass the results of `ls` to the `rm` function:


~~~
rm(list = ls())
~~~
{: .r}

In this case we've combined the two. Like the order of operations, anything
inside the innermost parentheses is evaluated first, and so on.

In this case we've specified that the results of `ls` should be used for the
`list` argument in `rm`. When assigning values to arguments by name, you *must*
use the `=` operator, and not `<-`

If instead we use `<-`, there will be unintended side effects, or you may get an error message:


~~~
rm(list <- ls())
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
Error in rm(list <- ls()): ... must contain names or character strings
~~~
{: .error}

> ## Tip: Warnings vs. Errors
>
> Pay attention when R does something unexpected! Errors, like above,
> are thrown when R cannot proceed with a calculation. Warnings on the
> other hand usually mean that the function has run, but it probably
> hasn't worked as expected.
>
> In both cases, the message that R prints out usually give you clues
> how to fix a problem.

## Comments

If we include the `#` symbol in a command in R, everything following it will be ignored.  This
lets us enter comments into our code.
