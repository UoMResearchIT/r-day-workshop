## Reading Help files

R, and every package, provide help files for functions. The general syntax to search for help on any
function, "function_name", from a specific function that is in a package loaded into your
namespace (your interactive R session):


~~~
?function_name
help(function_name)
~~~
{: .r}

This will load up a help page in RStudio (or by launching a web browser, or  as plain text if you are using R without RStudio).

Each help page is broken down into sections:

 - Description: An extended description of what the function does.
 - Usage: The arguments of the function and their default values.
 - Arguments: An explanation of the data each argument is expecting.
 - Details: Any important details to be aware of.
 - Value: The data the function returns.
 - See Also: Any related functions you might find useful.
 - Examples: Some examples for how to use the function.

Different functions might have different sections, but these are the main ones you should be aware of.

> One of the most daunting aspects of R is the large number of functions

> correct usage for every function you use. Luckily, the help files
> mean you don't have to!

## Special Operators

To seek help on special operators, use quotes:


~~~
?"<-"
~~~
{: .r}

## Getting help on packages

Many packages come with "vignettes": tutorials and extended example documentation.
Without any arguments, `vignette()` will list all vignettes for all installed packages;
`vignette(package="package-name")` will list all available vignettes for
`package-name`, and `vignette("vignette-name")` will open the specified vignette.

If a package doesn't have any vignettes, you can usually find help by typing
`help("package-name")`, or `package?package-name`.

## When you kind of remember the function

If you're not sure what package a function is in, or how it's specifically spelled you can do a fuzzy search:


~~~
??function_name
~~~
{: .r}


## When your code doesn't work: seeking help from your peers

If you're having trouble using a function, 9 times out of 10,
the answers you are seeking have already been answered on
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). You can search using
the `[r]` tag.

If you can't find the answer, there are a few useful functions to
help you ask a question from your peers:


~~~
?dput
~~~
{: .r}

Will dump the data you're working with into a format so that it can
be copy and pasted by anyone else into their R session.


~~~
sessionInfo()
~~~
{: .r}

Will print out your current version of R, as well as any packages you
have loaded. This can be useful for others to help reproduce and debug
your issue.

> ## Challenge 1
>
> Look at the help for the combine function, `c`. What kind of vector do you
> expect you will create if you evaluate the following:
> 
> ~~~
> c(1, 2, 3)
> c('d', 'e', 'f')
> c(1, 2, 'f')
> ~~~
> {: .r}
> > ## Solution to Challenge 1
> >
> > The `c()` function creates a vector, in which all elements are the
> > same type. In the first case, the elements are numeric, in the
> > second, they are characters, and in the third they are characters:
> > the numeric values are "coerced" to be characters.

> ## Challenge 2
>
> Look at the help for the `paste` function. You'll need to use this later.
> What is the difference between the `sep` and `collapse` arguments?
>
> > ## Solution to Challenge 2
> >
> > To look at the help for the `paste()` function, use:
> > 
> > ~~~
> > help("paste")
> > ?paste
> > ~~~
> > {: .r}
> > The difference between `sep` and `collapse` is a little
> > tricky. The `paste` function accepts any number of arguments, each of which
> > can be a vector of any length. The `sep` argument specifies the string
> > used between concatenated terms â€” by default, a space. The result is a
> > vector as long as the longest argument supplied to `paste`. In contrast,
> > `collapse` specifies that after concatenation the elements are *collapsed*
> > together using the given separator, the result being a single string.
